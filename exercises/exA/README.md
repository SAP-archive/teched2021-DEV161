# Exercise A - Create a new AppGyver Project
In this exercise we will create an app for our mobile consumers where they can browse the list of heroes and place an order. This app will consume some of the APIs we created in the first part of this session.


## Excercise A.1 First steps in SAP AppGyver

We will start our AppGyver development in the Lobby, where we also started our BAS project. Open a new browser tab and navigate to:

[Application Development Lobby](https://lcapteched2021-applicationdevelopment.lcnc.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/)

Click on "Create" button, but this time you select the "AppGyver Project" option.

In the dialog which appears, provide the project name based on your username such as "HeroRent001", where XX is your user number.

After a few seconds AppGyver will appear and present you the design time for your project:

1. This is the palette, where you find the UX controls that you can drag&drop into your page canvas
2. This is the top navigation bar, where you can find the various other editor views/topics such as DATA, which handles connectivity
3. Here you can see the properties of the selected item on the page canvas and below you see a hirarchy view of the UX components that you have put already onto your page.
4. Here you can switch between the "Variable" view and the page canvas which we see right now.
5. Page canvas, where you design your views.

At the bottom you will find the intergrated support experience (the violett bar at the bottom). The grey bar can be expanded and it shows the logic canvas where you can implement the behavior of your app.





## Summary
We now have an overview of the AppGyver design time.
