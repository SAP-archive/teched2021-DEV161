## General troubleshooting

1. When you encounter an issue with the Low-Code perspective in BAS you can check the logs under: File > Open > /home/user/lcap.home.2021-11-17.log

1. When something does not work in the editor, but it should, you can try restarting the whole workspace. To do so, open this URL: https://lcapteched2021.eu10cf.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/index.html.  
Here you see the so-called Dev Spaces of the Business application studio. Click on the "Stop" button. Once the Dev Space stopped, you can simply restart them. In order to go back to your Low-Code perspective you must go through the lobby - located here:
